In this episode, we go through Jon's origin story and hear about how he got started with programming. We hear about how badly he did in high school and how that drove him away from tertiary education. We hear about his time in the theatre industry, Apple hardware repairs, tech support, teaching at a University, developing curriculum for a web development bootcamp, working as a software engineer and eventually switching careers into his role as a Developer Advocate at Supabase.
