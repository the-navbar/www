In this episode, Jon and Simon break down the gear you actually need to get started with content creation.

Spoilers! It is not very much or overly expensive! 🙌

They discuss an incremental upgrade path, so you don't need to buy everything at the same time, and look at which bits of gear make the biggest difference.
